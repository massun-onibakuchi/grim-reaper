## Getting Started

This is [grim-reaper](https://github.com/massun-onibakuchi/grim-reaper): EVM-based on-chain liquidation bot for Aave V3 built with Huff language. Optimized for gas efficiency.
This repo doesn't include any off-chain architecture.

### Requirements

The following will need to be installed. Please follow the links and instructions.

- [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry)
- [Huff Compiler](https://docs.huff.sh/get-started/installing/)

### Quickstart

1. Install dependencies

Once you've cloned and entered into your repository, you need to install the necessary dependencies. In order to do so, simply run:

```shell
pnpm install
forge install
```

2. Build & Test

To build and test your contracts, you can run:

```shell
forge build
forge test
```

For more information on how to use Foundry, check out the [Foundry Github Repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) and the [foundry-huff library repository](https://github.com/huff-language/foundry-huff).

| Single Liquidation                             | Gas Used | Bytecode Size (kB) |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Solidity Contract (Optimizer runs: 200)        | 97944    | 1.005              |
| Assembly (Optimizer runs: 200)                 | 97319    | 0.313              |
| Huff Contract (Optimizer runs: 200)            | 97261    | 0.256              |
| Solidity Contract (Optimizer runs: 10_000_000) | 97350    | 1.308              |
| Assembly (Optimizer runs: 10_000_000)          | 96779    | 0.372              |
| Huff Contract (Optimizer runs: 10_000_000)     | 96733    | 0.256              |

> Note: Optimizer runs affects how well the compiler optimizes tests contract as well. So, it affects measurements.

- solc version: 0.8.24, evm version: cancun with `bytecode_hash = "none"` and `cbor_metadata = false`
