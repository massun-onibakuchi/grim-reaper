## Getting Started

This is [grim-reaper](https://github.com/massun-onibakuchi/grim-reaper): EVM-based on-chain liquidation bot for Aave V3 built with Huff language. Optimized for gas efficiency.
This repo doesn't include any off-chain architecture.

### Requirements

The following will need to be installed. Please follow the links and instructions.

- [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry)
- [Huff Compiler](https://docs.huff.sh/get-started/installing/)

### Quickstart

1. Install dependencies

Once you've cloned and entered into your repository, you need to install the necessary dependencies. In order to do so, simply run:

```shell
pnpm install
forge install
```

2. Build & Test

To build and test your contracts, you can run:

```shell
forge build
forge test
```

For more information on how to use Foundry, check out the [Foundry Github Repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) and the [foundry-huff library repository](https://github.com/huff-language/foundry-huff).

> `66270` gas is used for the liquidation logic itself on mock Aave v3 pool.

> Note: Optimizer runs affects how well the compiler optimizes tests contract as well. So, it affects measurements.

- solc version: 0.8.24, evm version: cancun with `bytecode_hash = "none"` and `cbor_metadata = false`.
- `forge snapshot --fuzz-seed=111 -vv`

## Further Optimization Ideas

- Support limited kinds of collateral tokens and remove `collateral` parameter from main entrypoint
  - [x] O(1) selector table for token addresses. (`GrimReaper V2`)
  - [ ] Approve once on contract deployment instead of every liquidation
- Replace `jumpi` with other operations
  - [x] Use `mload(type(uint256).max)` for `jumpi` if-else-revert pattern (`GrimReaperHuff`)
